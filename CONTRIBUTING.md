# Contributing to Employee Timesheet Manager

I appreciate your interest in contributing to the Employee Timesheet Manager project! I welcome contributions from the community in the form of bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Create a fork of the `employee-timesheet-manager` repository on GitHub. This will create your own copy of the codebase that you can modify.
2. **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git. This will allow you to make changes to the code locally.
3. **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for your specific contribution. This helps to isolate your changes from the main codebase.
4. **Make your changes:** Make the desired changes to the codebase following my coding conventions (explained below).
5. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Each commit message should explain what you changed and why.
6. **Push your changes:** Push your committed changes to your forked branch on GitHub.
7. **Open a pull request:** Create a pull request from your forked branch to the main branch of the upstream repository. This will notify the project maintainers about your contribution.

## Coding Conventions

- I recommend following common Java coding conventions like [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
- Use consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces).
- Add meaningful comments to your code to explain its functionality.

## Testing Your Changes

- I encourage you to write unit tests for your changes to ensure they don't break existing functionality.
- If the project already has existing tests, run them before submitting your pull request.

## Getting Your Pull Request Merged

- Once you submit a pull request, a project maintainer will review your changes.
- Be prepared to answer questions and make adjustments based on the feedback provided.
- If your pull request is accepted, it will be merged into the main codebase.

## Additional Notes

- Feel free to discuss your contribution ideas before starting work on them by creating an issue in the repository.
- I appreciate contributions of all sizes, from small bug fixes to major new features.

Thank you for contributing!
